# Welcome to VOX-AI Fantasy Chat

VOX-AI is a powerful, locally-hosted roleplaying interface designed to bring your fantasies to life. Using advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) running directly on your machine, it creates immersive, interactive stories where you are the hero (or villain).

## 🧠 How the AI Works

This application uses **Local LLMs** (Large Language Models) like Dolphin, Mistral, or Llama. These are AI brains that live on your computer, meaning:
*   **Privacy**: Your chats never leave your PC.
*   **Control**: You decide what is allowed.
*   **Cost**: Free to run (uses your hardware).

### The "Passion Level" (Temperature)
In the Fantasy Editor, you will see a slider called **Passion Level**. This controls how "creative" or "chaotic" the AI is.
*   **Tame (0.1 - 0.7)**: The AI is logical, consistent, and follows instructions strictly. Good for serious lore or complex plots.
*   **Wild (0.8 - 1.5)**: The AI becomes more unpredictable, creative, and intense. Good for high-energy scenes or brainstorming.

### Model Categories
When selecting a model, you will see tags:
*   **🛡️ (Safe - Restricted)**: These models are trained to be helpful and harmless. They may refuse certain NSFW or violent topics.
*   **🔓 (Unrestricted - Creative)**: These models (like Dolphin) are "uncensored." They will roleplay *anything* you ask, including violence, grimdark themes, or adult content.

## ✍️ Creating a Fantasy Card

A "Fantasy Card" defines the universe and characters for your chat.

### Example 1: High Fantasy Adventure
**Title**: The Lost Kingdom of Eldoria
**Your Name**: Sir Kaelen (Knight)
**AI Name**: Dungeon Master
**Description**: A classic D&D style adventure.
**System Prompt**:
```text
You are the Dungeon Master. I am Sir Kaelen, a knight seeking the lost crown. 
Describe the world in vivid detail. 
Manage NPCs, monsters, and loot. 
Do not act for me. Let me make my own choices.
```

### Example 2: Sci-Fi Noir
**Title**: Neon Rain
**Your Name**: Detective Vance
**AI Name**: The City
**Description**: A gritty cyberpunk mystery.
**System Prompt**:
```text
You are the narrator of a dark cyberpunk city called Neo-Veridia. 
The year is 2099. Rain never stops. 
Describe the smells, the neon lights, and the tech. 
I am Vance, a private eye. 
Keep the tone cynical and dark.
```

### Example 3: Character Roleplay
**Title**: Dinner with Dracula
**Your Name**: Mina
**AI Name**: Count Dracula
**Description**: A tense conversation with a vampire.
**System Prompt**:
```text
Roleplay as Count Dracula. You are polite, charming, but secretly dangerous. 
You are hosting me (Mina) for dinner at your castle. 
Speak in an old-fashioned, elegant manner. 
Do not reveal your vampire nature immediately.
```

## 🎨 Themes

You can customize the look of your chat with themes in the editor:
*   **Default (Parchment)**: Classic paper feel.
*   **Magical Night**: Dark blue/purple for late-night sessions.
*   **Forest**: Deep greens for nature adventures.
*   **Blood**: Red/Black for horror or combat focus.

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

**"The AI isn't replying!"**
*   Check the console window (the black box that opened with the app).
*   It might be loading the model (this takes time for the first message).
*   If it crashes, try a lower "Passion Level" or a different model.

**"The response is cut off."**
*   Just type "Continue" and hit send.

**"I want to reset the story."**
*   Click the **Reset** button (circular arrow) in the top right of the chat header. This wipes the memory of the current chat.
