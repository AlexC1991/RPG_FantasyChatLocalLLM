I need to make sure we're not missing any important landmarks or hidden dangers along the way. Shall we pack up our gear and set out?"

      "content": "Penny: My parents would never want to see me go on adventures like this, York. They're quite traditional and prefer I stick close to home for now. But as a druid, I have my own sense of duty and purpose. This journey is important for the balance of nature, and I must follow my path as well. They understand that sometimes, a druid's work takes them far from their usual life. So, worry not about my parents' approval; they know better than to stand in the way of destiny."
